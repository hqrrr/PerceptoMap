### Visualizing how we hear — from spectrograms to perception

PerceptoMap is an open-source audio plugin (VST3) that visualizes psychoacoustic features of audio signals in real time. Built with [JUCE](https://juce.com/), it's designed to help you **see** how we **perceive** sound — not just how it looks on a frequency plot.

Unlike typical spectrum or spectrogram analyzers, it supports perceptual visualizations such as **Mel spectrograms**, **Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs)**, **Chromagram**, and soon also **Tempogram** etc., offering insight into how humans perceive sound.

> 🎧 If you're the kind of creator who trusts your ears above all — you might not need this.  
> But if you're curious about how your audio *measures up* to what humans actually hear… welcome aboard.

## Key Features

- Real-time **Mel Spectrogram** display with perceptual frequency scaling
- Real-time **Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs)** representing timbral texture and spectral envelope
- Real-time **Spectral Centroid** tracking to visualize spectral brightness (center of mass of STFT spectrum)
- Real-time **Chromagram** showing the energy distribution across the 12 pitch classes (C to B), regardless of octave. <span style="color: gray;">[added in v0.5]</span>
- **Time-Frequency Reassignment** mode (Linear+) for enhanced STFT resolution, based on the paper [[hal-00414583: Time-Frequency reassignment: from principles to algorithms](https://hal.science/hal-00414583/document)]. This mode sharpens the localization of spectral peaks by reassigning energy to more accurate time-frequency coordinates, making harmonic structures and transient details clearer compared to the standard STFT. <span style="color: gray;">[added in v0.6]</span>
- **Time-Frequency Reassigned Mel Spectrogram** mode (Mel+) - Mel-scaled display using the same time-frequency reassignment principle as Linear+. It computes the reassigned frequency from the complex STFT and then projects energy onto the Mel axis, yielding sharper harmonic ridges and crisper transients than a standard Mel spectrogram. <span style="color: gray;">[added in v0.7]</span>
- Visual analysis of **Tempogram** and other psychoacoustic features *(planned)* 
- Configurable color maps
- Adjustable brightness gain and enhanced colormap modes to improve visibility of fine details in the spectrogram <span style="color: gray;">[added in v0.4]</span>
- Optional dB scaling, log or linear frequency axis for classic linear STFT spectrogram
- Freeze frame mode and interactive mouse hover to inspect frequency and loudness at any point
- Configurable FFT size for balancing time resolution and frequency resolution.<span style="color: gray;">[added in v0.6]</span>
- Independent scroll speed control, allowing smooth visualization at different FFT sizes and overlap settings without distorting the spectral data. <span style="color: gray;">[added in v0.6]</span>
- Adjustable y-axis frequency range. <span style="color: gray;">[added in v0.8]</span>

## Roadmap

| Feature | Status | Description | Implementation Details |
|-|-|-|-|
| Linear STFT Spectrogram | ✅ Done (v0.1) | Classic time–frequency analysis | Hann window, with log/linear frequency axis display and adjustable FFT size & scroll speed [added in v0.6]|
| Mel-Spectrogram | ✅ Done (v0.1) | Nonlinear frequency scaling approximating human pitch perception | 128 bands, Slaney-style: `2595 * log10(1 + f / 700)`|
| MFCC | ✅ Done (v0.2) | Mel frequency cepstral coefficients, compact representation of timbre based on perceptual log-mel spectrum | DCT-II on log-mel spectrum, 20 coefficients, no liftering, values clipped to [−100, 100] and normalized to [0, 1] for display |
| Spectral Centroid (STFT-based) | ✅ Done (v0.3) | Tracks the "center of mass" of the spectrum; correlates with brightness and sharpness | Computed from linear STFT magnitude spectrum with smoothing (Exponential Moving Average), overlaid as a curve on the STFT spectrogram |
| Adjustable brightness gain and enhanced colormap modes | ✅ Done (v0.4) | To improve visibility of fine details in the spectrogram | Brightness remapped using non-linear scaling; norm factor slider controls global dB scaling, color maps applied after brightness normalization |
| Chroma | ✅ Done (v0.5) | Pitch class mapping, projection of spectral energy onto 12 pitch classes (C, C#, D…) | Triangular chroma filter bank built from STFT bins, 12 overlapping filters per octave; energy mapped to pitch classes regardless of octave; supports smooth pitch transitions and partial overlaps |
| Enhanced STFT with Time–Frequency Reassignment (Linear+) | ✅ Done (v0.6) | Sharper time–frequency localization by reassigning each STFT bin’s energy to more accurate time/frequency coordinates | Based on [[hal-00414583: Time-Frequency reassignment: from principles to algorithms](https://hal.science/hal-00414583/document)], implemented with Gaussian-window STFT and its time & frequency derivatives. Instantaneous frequency and group delay estimates are used to re-map spectral energy, improving localization of transients and harmonics compared to standard STFT. Supports same FFT size and log/linear axis options as Linear mode |
| Enhanced Mel Spectrogram with Time–Frequency Reassignment (Mel+) | ✅ Done (v0.7) | Mel-scaled spectrogram with sharper harmonic ridges and crisper transients by reassigning each STFT bins energy to its true instantaneous frequency, then projecting onto the Mel axis | Based on the same reassignment principle as Linear+. Mapped to Mel. |
| Y-axis Range Control | ✅ Done (v0.8) | Precise control over visible frequency band | Dual-handle range slider + editable min/max fields |
| Tempogram / Rhythm Map | ⏳ Planned | Visualizes perceived tempo and rhythmic periodicities over time | - |
| Spectral Flatness / Contrast | ⏳ Planned | Measures of timbral characteristics | - |

## Why develop this plugin?

In the fields of psychoacoustics, and machine learning, perceptually inspired representations such as **Mel spectrograms** and **MFCCs** are widely used — for example, in music genre classification, emotion recognition, or detecting AI-generated audio.  

As a frequent user of tools like [librosa](https://librosa.org/) in Python, while learning about DAWs, I was surprised to find that most DAWs seem to lack real-time, perceptually grounded visualization tools.  

So I decided to build one — a lightweight, JUCE-based plugin that brings these powerful analysis tools directly into the DAW environment, where musicians, sound designers, and researchers can explore them interactively.
