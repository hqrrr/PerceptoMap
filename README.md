# PerceptoMap

**Visualizing how we hear ‚Äî from spectrograms to perception**

PerceptoMap is an open-source audio plugin (VST3) that visualizes psychoacoustic features of audio signals in real time. Built with [JUCE](https://juce.com/), it's designed to help you **see** how we **perceive** sound ‚Äî not just how it looks on a frequency plot.

Unlike typical spectrum or spectrogram analyzers, it supports perceptual visualizations such as **Mel spectrograms**, and (soon) **MFCCs**, **Chroma**, **Tempogram** etc., offering insight into how humans perceive sound.

> üéß If you're the kind of creator who trusts your ears above all ‚Äî you might not need this.  
> But if you're curious about how your audio *measures up* to what humans actually hear‚Ä¶ welcome aboard.

## Features

- Real-time **Mel Spectrogram** display with perceptual frequency scaling  
- Visual analysis of **MFCCs**, **Chroma**, **Tempogram**, and other psychoacoustic features *(planned)*  
- Configurable color maps
- Optional dB scaling, log or linear frequency axis for classic linear STFT spectrogram
- Freeze frame mode and interactive mouse hover to inspect frequency and loudness at any point

## Roadmap

| Feature | Status | Description | Implementation Details |
|-|-|-|-|
| Linear STFT Spectrogram | ‚úÖ Done | Classic time‚Äìfrequency analysis | FFT size = 2048, Hann window, with log/linear frequency axis display|
| Mel-Spectrogram | ‚úÖ Done | Nonlinear frequency scaling approximating human pitch perception | 128 bands, Slaney-style: `2595 * log10(1 + f / 700)`|
| MFCC | ‚è≥ Planned | Mel frequency cepstral coefficients, compact representation of timbre based on perceptual log-mel spectrum | - |
| Chroma | ‚è≥ Planned | Pitch class mapping, projection of spectral energy onto 12 pitch classes (C, C#, D‚Ä¶) | - |
| Tempogram / Rhythm Map | ‚è≥ Planned | Visualizes perceived tempo and rhythmic periodicities over time | - |
| Spectral centroid / flatness | ‚è≥ Planned | Measures of brightness and tonal clarity in the spectrum | - |


## Why develop this plugin?

In the fields of psychoacoustics, and machine learning, perceptually inspired representations such as **Mel spectrograms** and **MFCCs** are widely used ‚Äî for example, in music genre classification, emotion recognition, or detecting AI-generated audio.  

As a frequent user of tools like [librosa](https://librosa.org/) in Python, while learning about DAWs, I was surprised to find that most DAWs seem to lack real-time, perceptually grounded visualization tools.  

So I decided to build one ‚Äî a lightweight, JUCE-based plugin that brings these powerful analysis tools directly into the DAW environment, where musicians, sound designers, and researchers can explore them interactively.


## How to install?

You can download the latest version of **PerceptoMap** from the [Releases](https://github.com/hqrrr/PerceptoMap/releases) page.

### Available Format

- VST3 (`.vst3`)

### Plugin installation paths

#### Windows
1. Download the plugin `.zip` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/hqrrr/PerceptoMap/releases)
2. Unzip the file
3. Copy `.vst3` **plugin folder** to the default system VST3 directory: `C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3\`
    
> Note: If you use a custom VST3 plugin path, copy it there instead.

4. Launch your DAW and run a plugin rescan if necessary
5. Then, you should be able to find the plugin under `hqrrr - PerceptoMap`

#### macOS

Not yet prebuilt ‚Äî If you're a developer or familiar with JUCE/Xcode, please build from source, see instructions for developers below.

> After installation, restart your DAW and run a plugin rescan if needed.

## Build Instructions for Developers

### Prerequisites

- JUCE 8.x (open-source under AGPLv3)
- C++17 compatible compiler
- Projucer (included in JUCE)

### Build with Projucer

1. Open `PerceptoMap.jucer` in **Projucer**
2. Click **Save Project and Open in IDE** (Visual Studio, Xcode, etc.)
3. Build the target for your desired format (VST3, AU, AAX etc. which you selected in Projucer setting)
4. The plugin binary will be placed in the build output directory
